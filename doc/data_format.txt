comment_root
  The trunk of the comment tree.  We use a dummy root comment by default,

  To simplify comment interaction, we condense these threads into a single

Comment
=======

Alt-Id
  Alternate ID for linking imported comments.  Internally comments are linked
  (via In-reply-to) to the parent's UUID.  However, these UUIDs are generated
  internally, so Alt-id is provided as a user-controlled linking target.

 The author of the comment 

In-reply-to
  UUID for parent comment or bug

  Mime type for comment body

Date
  An RFC 2822 timestamp for comment creation
